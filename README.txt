Gesture recognition using both hands was implemented.
Prerequisites: Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, Kinect SDk (1.6 or above)

Important:
1. The application can be started by opening the file 'Gesture Recognition - CEERI SOP' and running the code.
2. File 'SkeletonBasics-WPF' also contains the C# GUI and skeleton tracking code, which automatically calls the C++ DTW code.
3. The C++ implementation for DTW based comparison is a precompiled binary file located at '/bin/Debug/main.exe'
4. Trained gestures are stored in 'bin/Debug/train/right' and 'bin/Debug/train/left' for right and left hand components respectively.
5. Test gesture files are temporarily stored in 'bin/Debug/'
